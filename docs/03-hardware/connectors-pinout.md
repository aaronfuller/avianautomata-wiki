## Power — CN1

**6-pin JST-GH.** Main battery input.

| Pin | Signal |
|---|---|
| 1 | VBAT\_IN |
| 2 | VBAT\_IN |
| 3 | VBAT\_IN |
| 4 | GND |
| 5 | GND |
| 6 | GND |

Pins 1–3 are paralleled for current capacity and lower contact resistance. Pins 4–6 are paralleled ground. This connector feeds the board's protected VBAT input (fuse → TVS → ideal-diode front end).

**Input voltage:** 2S–6S LiPo / Li-ion (approximately 7–25.2 V).

| 4 | TM1\_UART\_CTS | UART4 CTS (PB0) |
| 5 | TM1\_UART\_RTS | UART4 RTS (PB14) |
| 6 | GND | — |

Default function: MAVLink (TEL1). Hardware flow control is supported. Enable via `MAV_0_FLOW_CTRL` in QGroundControl without a firmware rebuild.

## TELEM 2 — CN3

**6-pin JST-GH.** Secondary telemetry port with hardware flow control.

| Pin | Signal | MCU |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | +5V | — |
| 2 | TM2\_UART\_TX | UART7 TX (PE8) |
| 3 | TM2\_UART\_RX | UART7 RX (PE7) |
| 4 | TM2\_UART\_CTS | UART7 CTS (PE10) |
| 5 | TM2\_UART\_RTS | UART7 RTS (PE9) |
| 6 | GND | — |

Default function: TEL2. Commonly used for companion computers. Hardware flow control enabled by default.

## Basic GPS — CN4

**6-pin JST-GH.** UART GPS with I2C compass support.

| Pin | Signal | MCU |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | +5V | — |
| 2 | GPS\_UART\_TX | USART6 TX (PC6) |
| 3 | GPS\_UART\_RX | USART6 RX (PC7) |
| 4 | GPS\_I2C\_SCL | I2C4 SCL (PD12) |
| 5 | GPS\_I2C\_SDA | I2C4 SDA (PD13) |
| 6 | GND | — |

I2C lines are pulled up to 3.3 V on-board. Supports UART GPS modules with an integrated compass (connect compass via I2C4). Compatible with M8N, M9N, F9P, and similar modules using a standard 6-pin GPS cable.

:::note GPS port compatibility
This is a 6-pin port, not the full 10-pin Pixhawk GPS+safety-switch port. GPS modules that include a buzzer, safety switch, or LED typically use the 10-pin format and are not directly compatible.

## CAN 1 — U18

**4-pin JST-GH.** FDCAN1 bus.

| Pin | Signal |
|---|---|
| 1 | +5V |
| 2 | CAN1\_H |
| 3 | CAN1\_L |
| 4 | GND |

:::note Onboard termination
The 305ap includes two 120 Ω termination resistors onboard for this port. The bus is fully terminated at the FC. **Do not add any external termination resistors** — doing so will lower bus impedance below spec and cause signal integrity issues.

## CAN 2 — U19

**4-pin JST-GH.** FDCAN2 bus.

| Pin | Signal |
|---|---|
| 1 | +5V |
| 2 | CAN2\_H |
| 3 | CAN2\_L |
| 4 | GND |

Same termination applies: two 120 Ω resistors onboard, bus fully terminated at the FC. Do not add external terminators. See [CANBUS](can-bus) for DroneCAN configuration.

## External I2C — U20

**4-pin JST-GH.** General-purpose I2C expansion.

| Pin | Signal | MCU |

| 3 | GND | — |

Single-wire input via UART5 SINGLEWIRE+SWAP. CRSF and uninverted ELRS are fully supported. For SBUS, PX4 uses hardware UART inversion on the STM32H7. For CRSF/ELRS receivers that need a full-duplex UART, connect to TELEM 1 or TELEM 2 and reassign the port function in QGroundControl.

## USB-C — USBC1

Standard USB-C receptacle. USB 2.0 Full Speed device.

| Signal | Notes |
|---|---|
| D+ / D− | USB 2.0 FS data (PA12 / PA11) |
| VBUS | Feeds 5 V power mux (TPS2116) — board can run from USB alone |
| CC1 / CC2 | 5.1 kΩ to GND — identifies board as a standard 5 V USB sink |
| GND / Shield | — |

ESD protection via USBLC6-4SC6. No USB Power Delivery. 5 V only. No VBUS detection line in firmware.
