# avian automata 305ap

The 305ap is a compact, high-performance flight controller for multirotor, fixed-wing, and rover platforms. It runs [PX4](https://px4.io) on NuttX RTOS, built around the STM32H743VIH6. The board follows a 30.5 mm mounting pattern and is aimed at the PX4 ecosystem with dual FDCAN, dual telemetry, a dedicated VTX power rail, and a full onboard sensor suite with redundant IMUs.

## Design Notes

- **Dual IMUs.** Two IMU slots on SPI2 and SPI3. Each slot supports the ST LSM6DSV (primary) or TDK InvenSense ICM-45686 (fallback) — firmware auto-detects at boot via WHO_AM_I. PX4 runs sensor voting across both and falls back if one diverges.
- **Low-noise sensor rail.** The IMUs, barometer, and magnetometer are powered from a separate RT9193 ultra-low-noise 3.3 V LDO, isolated from the main digital 3.3 V switcher via a ferrite bead.
- **Wide input voltage.** The VBAT path uses an LM74700-Q1 ideal-diode controller with an external N-FET, providing 2S–6S input support with low forward drop and protection against reverse polarity.
- **Dedicated 9 V rail.** A second AP63357 buck provides a stable 9 V rail for VTX/OSD power, independent of the 5 V peripheral rail.
- **Auto USB / battery power.** A TPS2116 mux selects between USB 5 V and the onboard 5 V switcher automatically, so the board powers cleanly from USB alone during bench work.
- **No onboard current shunt.** The ASENSE pin accepts a 0–3.3 V signal from an external current sensor (power module or ESC with current output). No current data is available without one.
- **No safety/arm switch.** Arming is via RC stick command or GCS only. Set `COM_ARM_SWSBTN` appropriately.
- **Parameters on SD card.** No FRAM. Parameters are stored at `/fs/microsd/params`. A card must be inserted for parameters to persist across reboots.
- **No inversion stage on RC input.** UART5 is single-wire half-duplex. SBUS compatibility depends on PX4's software inversion support for the H7 UART. CRSF and uninverted ELRS are fully supported.
- **MCU package.** TFBGA100 exposes GPIO ports A–E only. All pin assignments reflect this constraint.
